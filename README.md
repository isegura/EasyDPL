# EasyDPL corpus


Drug Package Leaflets (DPLs) provide information for patients on how to safely use medicines. Pharmaceutical companies are responsible for producing these documents. 

However, several studies have shown that patients usually have problems in understanding sections describing posology (dosage quantity and prescription), contraindications and adverse drug reactions. 

EasyDPL is a collection of drug package leaflets where adverse drug effects are annotated and an easier 
synonym is provided for each adverse drug effect. We provide the dataset in two different formats: XML and BRAT.
